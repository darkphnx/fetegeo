To install Fetegeo you need to have Python installed (tested with 2.5.2) and
a database and database connector. Currently only PostgreSQL is supported;
any DB API compatible database connector (e.g. PyGreSQL) should work.

To install, copy Fetegeo to your desired location. You then need to populate
the database. If you do not have a PostgreSQL database up and running you can
create one with:

  $ initdb -D data

where 'data' is the name of a directory (which PostgreSQL will create) and
which will be the database store.

Assuming you have a PostgreSQL database up and running the following two
commands:

  $ cd import
  $ ./postgres_geonames.sh

are the easiest way to import data. Note that running "postgres_geonames.sh"
will create a database called fetegeo (and will wipe a database of that name
if it exists). Importing the data is likely to take many hours; however you
can start testing with incomplete data as soon as Fetegeo has imported a
couple of countries worth of data.

The easiest way to test things is to run the server fetegeos in one shell:

  $ ./fetegeos

and in another shell run either the test suite:

  $ cd tests
  $ python testall.py

or use the command-line client fetegeoc:

  $ fetegeoc geo <place name>
